## [Unreleased]
### Added
- It is now possible to specify `font_size_precision` when instantiating a PDFDocument. This is the number of decimal places the font size will be rounded to. ([#60](https://github.com/optimor/py-pdf-parser/pull/60))
- `extract_simple_table` now allows extracting tables with gaps, provided there is at least one full row and one full column. This is only the case if you pass `allow_gaps=True`, otherwise the original logic of raising an exception if there a gap remains. You can optionally pass a `reference_element` which must be in both a full row and a full column, this defaults to the first (top-left) element. ([#57](https://github.com/optimor/py-pdf-parser/pull/57))

### Changed
- Font sizes are now `float` not `int`. The `font_size_precision` in the additions defaults to 1, and as such all fonts will change to have a single decimal place. To keep the old behaviour, you can pass `font_size_precision=0` when instantiating your PDFDocument.

### Fixed
- Improved performance of `extract_simple_table`, which is now much faster. ([#65](https://github.com/optimor/py-pdf-parser/pull/65))

## [0.1.0] - 2019-04-08
### Added
- Initial version of the product. Note: The version is less than 1, so this product should not yet be considered stable. API changes and other breaking changes are possible, if not likely.
