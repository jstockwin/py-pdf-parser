    """
    Returns elements structured as a table.

    Given an ElementList, tries to extract a structured table by examining which
    elements are aligned.

    To use this function, there must be at least one full row and one full column (which
    we call the reference row and column), i.e. the reference row must have an element
    in every column, and the reference column must have an element in every row. The
    reference row and column can be specified by passing the single element in both the
    reference row and the reference column. By default, this is the top left element,
    which means we use the first row and column as the references. Note if you need to
    change the reference_element, that means you have gaps in your table, and as such
    you will need to pass `allow_gaps=True`.

    Important: This function uses the elements in the reference row and column to scan
    horizontally and vertically to find the rest of the table. If there are gaps in your
    reference row and column, this could result in rows and columns being missed by
    this function.

    There must be a clear gap between each row and between each column which contains no
    elements, and a single cell cannot contain multiple elements.

    If there are no valid reference rows or columns, try extract_table() instead. If you
    have elements spanning multiple rows or columns, it may be possible to fix this by
    using extract_table(). If you fail to satisfy any of the other conditions listed
    above, that case is not yet supported.

    Args:
        elements (ElementList): A list of elements to extract into a table.
        reference_element (PDFElement, optional): An element in a full row and a full
            column. Will be used to specify the reference row and column. If None, the
            top left element will be used, meaning the top row and left column will be
            used. If there are gaps in these, you should specify a different reference.
            Default: None.
        as_text (bool, optional): Whether to extract the text from each element instead
            of the PDFElement itself. Default: False.
        strip_text (bool, optional): Whether to strip the text for each element of the
                table (Only relevant if as_text is True). Default: True.
        allow_gaps (bool, optional): Whether to allow empty spaces in the table.
        tolerance (int, optional): For elements to be counted as in the same row or
            column, they must overlap by at least `tolerance`. Default: 0.

    Raises:
        TableExtractionError: If something goes wrong.

    Returns:
        list[list]: a list of rows, which are lists of PDFElements or strings
            (depending on the value of as_text).
